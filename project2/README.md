# NEW PROJECT
This project was created on local system.
Created by SHUBHANGI SINGH

If we're just modifying a file(not creating one) then we can add and commit by a single command -->git commit -am "removed full stop."

If we write "git push -u origin main" once then we can simply write "git push" henceforth as by adding 'u' we set upstream(we've already set where we need to send our data once--> to origin main).
